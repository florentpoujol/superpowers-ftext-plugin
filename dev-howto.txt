How to add support for an extension/language/CM mode

Nothing is needed if the extension is the same as the language name and the corresponding CodeMirror's

If the extension is shorter than the language name, update the 'data.modesByExtensions' object in editors/fText/network.ts
ie : .md and markdown

How to add lint for a language

- require the linter or parser in editors/fText/network.ts
ie :  (window as any).pug = require("pug");

- add Codemirror's lint file for this language in the public folder
ie: public/codemirror/addon/lint-custom

- reference this file from editors/fText/index.jade
ie :    script(src="../../codemirror/addon/lint-custom/pug-lint.js")

- update the data.lintedModes
